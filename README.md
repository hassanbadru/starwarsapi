### YouGov - Starwars API

## Solution
### Install Virtual Environment
With Python 3, run the following command to create a new virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/[ENVIRONMENT NAME]
```
Activate the new virtual environment
```bash
source 'path/to/[ENVIRONMENT NAME]/bin/activate'
```
Navigate to project root folder
```

```

### Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the necessary dependencies with requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Packages
- [x] Requests
- [x] PyTest

### Run solution
```bash
python yougov.py
```
Output
```
$ results csv produced
```

This solution would produce the file ```characters.csv``` and add this file to **output** folder within the root directory. **output** folder is created if it doesn't  exist.


### Testing
To run test:
```bash
py.test -vv
```

## Functionality
- [x] Finds characters who appear in the most Star Wars films
- [x] Sorts top ten characters by height in descending order
- [x] Produces a CSV with the following columns: name, species, height, appearances
- [x] Sends the CSV to httpbin.org


## Design & Approach
- Traverse recursively to extract characters, starting from the endpoint's first page
- Compute appearances, height and finds species details for each character
- Create table / dictionary of name, species, height and appearances for each character
- Sort list of characters in descending order of appearance and slice to extract the top 10
- Take top 10 most appearances and sorts by height (tallest to shortest)
- Store as  name, species, height, appearances values as fields / records in a CSV file

### Custom Modules
- fetch_url() - extracts data from endpoint
- get_species() - gets name of species from endpoint
- produce_csv() - produces csv of the format 'name, species, height, appearances'
- get_characters() - fetches all the characters from all endpoint pages
- string_to_float() - converts any numeric string to float
- find_characters() - produces list of solution after sorting by height


### Assumptions
- 0.0 float for unknown heights
- N/A for no species data
